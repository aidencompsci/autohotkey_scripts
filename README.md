# autohotkey_scripts
Scripts for autohotkey that I use daily

- alt_keyb_ijkl_to_arrows
  - This script adds an alternate "layer" to 'any' keyboard which remaps the ijkl keys to the arrow keys. 
  - Some applications support this, most IDE's, most text editors, but it's not supported everywhere out of the box
  - Single point of change across all applications
